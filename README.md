# Scalable Moodle on AWS Deployment Workshop

## Overview

This repository is intended to provide AWS customers guidance on how to create a scalable Moodle deployment on AWS.

This guide uses Moodle version 4.0 as baseline; however, it might work with the other Moodle versions as well. It consisted of:
1. Steps to setup Cloud9 as IDE for deploying AWS CDK stack.
2. AWS CDK infrastructure-as-code used to deploy the baseline infrastructure. The intent for the CDK is to save time in deploying the required AWS services in a well-architected design for a scalable Moodle deployment. 
3. Step-by-step guidance in installing Moodle integrated with AWS services such as Amazon RDS, Amazon EFS, Amazon ElastiCache for Redis, and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling.
4. Next steps on possible improvement on the architecture and implementations.

## 1. Reference Architecture
The following is the architecture diagram for the CDK stack.

![Reference Architecture](docs/reference-architecture.png)

## 2. Deploying AWS CDK Infrastructure as Code
In this module, we will deploy the AWS CDK infrastructure-as-code to create the baseline infrastructure for scalable Moodle deployment on AWS.

### 2.1. Creating Cloud9 Environment
In this guide, we will use AWS Cloud9 as integrated development environment (IDE) to deploy the CDK stack. You can also use your own machine if you wish, more details on the AWS CDK getting started documentation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html 

1.	Open **AWS Cloud9 Console** at https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home 
2.	Check whether the region selection is already correct, if Cloud9 is not available within your region, you can also launch it in another region.
3.	On the **AWS Cloud9 Console**, choose **Create Environment**
4.	Enter the **Name** for your Cloud9 Workspace, then choose **Next step**
5.	On **Instance type**, choose **t3.small**, then choose **Next step**
6.	On **Review** page, choose **Create environment**

    ![Cloud9 Create Environment](docs/cloud9-create-environment.png)

### 2.2. Assigning Permission for Cloud9 Workspace
Before you can use the Cloud9 Workspace, you will need to configure it with appropriate permissions using AWS IAM Role.
1.	Follow this deep link to create **AWS IAM Role** with Full Administrator access for Cloud9 instance: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/roles$new?step=review&commonUseCase=EC2%2BEC2&selectedUseCase=EC2&policies=arn:aws:iam::aws:policy%2FAdministratorAccess 
2.	Ensure that the **AWS Service** and **EC2** is selected, then choose **Next** to view permission
3.	Ensure that **AdministratorAccess** is selected, then choose **Next: Tags**
4.	Leave it as default, then choose **Next: Review**
5.	Enter **cloud9-workspace-admin** for name, then choose **Create role**
6.	Follow this link to go to **AWS EC2 Instances Console**: https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?#Instances:sort=desc:launchTime 
7.	Choose Cloud9 instance, then choose **Actions > Security > Modify IAM Role**

    ![EC2 Modify IAM Role](/docs/ec2-modify-iam-role.png)

8.	Choose **cloud9-workspace-admin** from **IAM Role** dropdown list, then choose **Save**
9.	Go back to your **Cloud9 Workspace**, then choose **Settings** icon in the top-right corner. Choose **AWS Settings**, then deactivate the **AWS managed temporary credentials**

    ![Cloud9 Settings Managed Temp Credentials](/docs/cloud9-settings-managed-temp-credentials.png)

10.	Run the following in Cloud9 terminal to reboot the instance
    ```
    sudo reboot
    ```
11.	Wait untuk your Cloud9 Workspace is reconnected
12.	Run the following command to ensure that the permission is correctly attached from IAM Role
    ```
    aws sts get-caller-identity
    ```
    Ensure that **cloud9-workspace-admin** is shown in the **Arn** field
13.	Congratulations! Your Cloud9 Workspace is now ready to be used.

### 2.3. Creating EC2 Key Pair
You need to create an EC2 Key Pair so that you can connect to the Moodle Staging Server via SSH in the later sections.
1.	On your Cloud9 Workspace, run the following command to create an Amazon EC2 Key Pair. Modify the [YOUR-KEY-PAIR-NAME] and [YOUR-REGION] placeholder with the correct value.
    ```
    cd ~/environment
    aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name [YOUR-KEY-PAIR-NAME] --query 'KeyMaterial' --output text --region [YOUR-REGION] > MyKeyPair.pem
    ```
    The command will generate a new file named MyKeyPair.pem in your Cloud9 Workspace. This is your SSH private key file, please keep it safe and secure. You can also download the file into your local computer for future use.
2.	To view the key pair in the AWS Console, go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home#KeyPairs and ensure the correct region is selected.

### 2.4. Deploying CDK stack
In this section, we will deploy the CDK stack.
1.	Clone git repository and install the dependencies
    ```
    cd ~/environment
    git clone https://github.com/hendryanw/aws-cdk-scalable-moodle.git
    cd aws-cdk-scalable-moodle
    npm install
    ```
2.	Configure the region that you are deploying to by setting the AWS_REGION environment variable. For example, the following command set the target deployment region to ap-southeast-1 (Singapore) region.
    ```
    export AWS_REGION=ap-southeast-1
    ```
3.	Configure **keyName** field in the **aws-cdk-scalable-moodle/bin/cdk.ts** file using the **key-pair name** that you have created previously
4.	Bootstrap CDK. You only need to do this once.
    ```
    cdk bootstrap
    ```
5.	Deploy the CDK stack
    ```
    cdk deploy
    ```
6.	Once successfully deployed, you now have the baseline infrastructure ready to be installed and integrated with Moodle. You can continue to the next section.

### 2.5. Allow Cloud9 Workspace to SSH into Moodle Staging Server
In this section, you will configure Moodle Staging Server to allow SSH from your Cloud9 Workspace. You can also use your own local machine if you wish, the concept is still the same.
1.	To check your **Cloud9 public IP address**, run the following in the Cloud9 terminal
    ```
    curl checkip.amazonaws.com
    ```
    The command will print the public IP address used by your Cloud9 Workspace
2.	Open **Amazon EC2 Instances Console** https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?#Instances:sort=desc:launchTime
3.	Ensure that the selection region is correct
4.	Select the **Moodle Staging Server**, then on the **detail pane** below, select **Security** tab, then click on the **Security groups link** to go to the security group detail page

    ![EC2 Security Tab](docs/ec2-security-tab.png)

5.	On the **Security group detail** page, choose **Edit inbound rules**
6.  On the **Edit inbound rules** page, choose **Add rule**, then do the following:
    -  For **Type**, select **SSH**
    -  For **Source**, select **Custom**
    -	Enter the **Cloud9 public IP address** that youâ€™ve got from previous step and append **/32** behind the IP address. For example: 18.143.141.223/32
    -	Choose **Save rules**
    
        ![Security Groups Edit Inbound Rules](docs/security-groups-edit-inbound-rules.png)

## 6. Workshop Challenge

### 6.1. Enabling SSL on Application Load Balancer and CloudFront
In order to enable SSL on both Application Load Balancer and CloudFront, you will need a valid domain name. AWS recommends you to host your domain name on Amazon Route 53.

Below is the high-level guidance on how you can enable SSL on Application Load Balancer and CloudFront:
1.	Configure Moodle to support HTTPS with load balancer with the following settings in Moodle Staging Server
    ```
    $CFG->wwwroot   = 'https://'.$_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'];
    $CFG->sslproxy  = 1;
    ```
2.	Capture the new image from Moodle Staging Server and update the auto scaling group again to reflect the latest change.
3.	Create ACM public certificate in the region where you deploy your Moodle. This certificate will be used for Application Load Balancer.
4.	Create ACM public certificate in us-east-1 (N. Virginia). This certificate will be used for CloudFront
5.	Create a new HTTPS listener in Application Load Balancer and modify the existing HTTP listener to redirect to HTTPS
6.	Modify the origin under existing CloudFront Distribution to use HTTPS on origin request
7.	Modify CloudFront distribution settings to use the appropriate alternate domain name and TLS certificate
8.	Modify the behavior under existing CloudFront Distribution to redirect HTTP to HTTPS

The following are resources that you can use to enable the SSL:
1.	Moodle â€“ Transitioning to HTTPS: https://docs.moodle.org/400/en/Transitioning_to_HTTPS 
2.	Making Route 53 the DNS service for a domain thatâ€™s in use: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/migrate-dns-domain-in-use.html 
3.	AWS Certificate Manager - Requesting a public certificate: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-request-public.html 
4.	Create an HTTPS listener for your Application Load Balancer: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/create-https-listener.html 
5.	Redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS using an Application Load Balancer: https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/elb-redirect-http-to-https-using-alb/ 
6.	Requiring HTTPS for communication between CloudFront and your custom origin: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-cloudfront-to-custom-origin.html 
7.	Requiring HTTPS for communication between viewers and CloudFront: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-https-viewers-to-cloudfront.html 

## 7. Next Steps
You can refer to the following AWS services main page to improve the architecture of your Moodle application.
1.	Setup backup for your Moodle application using AWS Backup: https://aws.amazon.com/backup/
2.	Setup operational monitoring dashboard using Amazon CloudWatch: https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/ 
3.	Protect your Moodle web application using AWS WAF: https://aws.amazon.com/waf/
